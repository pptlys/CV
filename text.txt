I moved from France to Canada in 2014, obtained citizenship in 2019. I’m fluent in French, English and Chinese. 

As a longtime Tech enthusiast, I’ve been following every turn of development of the tech world, and I believe this global pandemic just started a new age of technology revolution. There is the perfect time to start a Tech career that I always wanted. So here I am, looking for every opportunity to get in the new world.
